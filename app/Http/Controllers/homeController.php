// The namespace defines a context under which the classes, interfaces, and functions reside. In this case, the controller you've created belongs to the App\Http\Controllers namespace. This helps prevent name collisions between classes and allows for organizing code into directory structures better. The comment //Where the file is? seems to be a personal addition or from a tutorial; it's not standard in Laravel and is merely a comment to help understand the purpose of the namespace.
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

// This line uses the use statement to import the Request class from the Illuminate\Http package. This means that within this controller, you can reference the Request class without having to type its full name, Illuminate\Http\Request, each time.
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

// This defines a new class named homeController that extends (or inherits from) Laravel's base Controller class. By extending this class, homeController inherits all properties and methods from the Controller class, allowing it to utilize all the basic functionality that Laravel provides for controllers.
class homeController extends Controller
{
    // THIS IS A METHOD OF THE CLASS
    public function __invoke() //just for one route, this is a method called __invoke
    {
        // return view('welcome');
        return view("home");
    }
